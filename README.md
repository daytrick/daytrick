# Hello there!

I'm Day (not really, but you can call me that). I'm interested in using computer science for storytelling, both for fun and for learning things. For instance, you can check out some of my favourite facts [here](https://daytrick.github.io/fun_facts).

When I'm not coding, I'll probably be drawing, animating, or writing murder mysteries.
